To start the app use Docker. It will start both frontend and backend, including all the relevant dependencies, and the db.

Please find more info about each part in the relevant Readme file ([frontend](frontend/readme.md) and [backend](backend/README.md)).

## Development

When implementing a new feature or fixing a bug, please create a new pull request against `main` from a feature/bug branch and add `@vanessa-cooper` as reviewer.

## First setup

**[TODO 05/01/2018 @vanessa-cooper]:** _It's been a while since anyone ran a fresh copy of this repo. I think it's worth documenting the steps needed to install and run the repo on a new machine?_
 ## First of all create your Codespace on Visual studio code and wait for it to boot ,then run 'docker-compose up
 wait for it to finish might take some minutes then test the server by going to https://obelusfamily-anythink-market-p55jv-76rx59r4766cp759-3000.githubpreview.dev/api/ping 
 then check if the front end is connected to the backend by going to https://obelusfamily-anythink-market-p55jv-76rx59r4766cp759-3001.githubpreview.dev/register and creating a new user
